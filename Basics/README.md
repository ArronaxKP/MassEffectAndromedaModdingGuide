# Basics

## How to get started?

* Join the Discord channels, that is where the most useful information is
  * Mass Effect Modding
  * Frosty Tool Suite
  * Modding Andromeda
* Install the game
  * [Origin - Recommended](https://www.origin.com/gbr/en-us/store/mass-effect/mass-effect-andromeda)
  * [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1238000/Mass_Effect_Andromeda_Deluxe_Edition/)

* Install Frosty Editor
  * Download the latest version from here - [Frost Tool Suite](http://frostytoolsuite.com/downloads.html)
  * Install it outside of Program Files. For me I "installed" (just unzipped) it to "D:\Games\Modding\FrostyEditor"

## Installing Mass Effect Andromeda

* Use the Origin version of the game - I have heard painful issues with the Steam version but if you have the steam version it is possible but you may have some pain
* Install into anywhere outside of "Program Files". For me I install all games in "D:\Games\Origin Games". You get a lot less UAC issues
